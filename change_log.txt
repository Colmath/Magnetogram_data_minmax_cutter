Change log for magneto_minmax_cutter

Version 1.0:
    - Initial release.

Version 1.1:
    - Changed invalid (empty) line handling: invalid lines are now counted into processed lines.
    - Changed error message for invalid lines: the number of the line in which the error occurred is now displayed.
    - New variable (counter) for valid lines added. The end result of the counter has been added to the log file.
    - Added a check to see if file can be located: if the specified file cannot be found in the specified location,
      the program asks again for the filename and location input.
    - Fixed bug where invalid lines were counted into processed, valid and deleted lines as well, resulting in
      incorrect numbers in the log files.
    - Added proper documentation for the code.
